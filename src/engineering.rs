//! Spatial operations expressed in engineering language.
//!
//! This module provides wrappers around the types in [`mod math`](crate::math) that are easier to
//! grok for those with more of an engineering background. The types here have slightly less
//! expressive power than the "raw" mathematical constructs there, but are more straightforward to
//! construct and use for common engineering applications.
//!
//! The main type provided by this module is [`Pose`], which describes an object's position and
//! orientation in a coordinate system (see [`CoordinateSystem`]). Poses can be converted between
//! coordinate systems using [`RigidBodyTransform`] (eg, [`RigidBodyTransform::transform`]).
//!
//! This module also provides the [`Orientation`] type to represents an object's orientation in a
//! coordinate system independent of its position. To represent just an object's position, you can
//! use [`Coordinate`], which is shared between the math and engineering modules.
//!
//! Orientation does not have a globally-unique definition (eg, what's the orientation of a
//! point or of a cube?). However, for the purposes of this module, every object is assumed to have
//! "body axes" that dictate what, eg, "forward" means for that object. By convention, the positive
//! X body axis is always "forward"/the direction of movement. The other two axes vary, but in
//! general the positive Y body axis is either left (commonly in ENU) or right (commonly in
//! [NED](NedLike)), and the positive Z body axis is either up (commonly in association with ENU)
//! or down (commonly in association with [NED](NedLike)). You'll sometimes see these body
//! coordinate systems referred to as Forward-Left-Up (FLU) and Forward-Right-Down
//! ([FRD](FrdLike)). An object's orientation is then the rotation that must be applied to the
//! reference system's axes such that it aligns with the body's axes.
//!
//! One method worth calling out in particular is [`Pose::map_as_zero_in`], which allows you to
//! start a new coordinate system with origin and rotation equal to that of the current pose. This
//! is, for example, how you'd construct a `RigidBodyTransform<_, PlaneFrd>`. To construct a
//! transform to or from a WGS84 location, you need to go via [`Ecef`] and
//! [`RigidBodyTransform::ecef_to_ned_at`].

    /// The meanings of yaw, pitch, and roll tend to align with common use in aerospace
    /// applications (eg, [`FrdLike`] or [`NedLike`]), but are more formally defined as described
    /// below.

    /// always; eg, this is [_not_ the case for ENU][enu]).
    ///
    /// Since we are using [intrinsic] rotations (by convention), we now consider further rotations
    /// (ie, pitch and roll) to be with respect to the axes _after_ applying the yaw. So, as an
    /// example, with a yaw of 90° in NED (ie, facing East), a pitch of 45° will tilt the nose of
    /// the plane up by 45° while still pointing the plane East.
    ///
    /// Pitch is rotation about the Y axis, with an object at 0° pitch facing along the positive X
    /// axis (again, this is the X axis with yaw applied). [`Bearing::elevation`] tends to have the
    /// same semantics as pitch (though again, [watch out for ENU][enu]!).
    ///
    /// Roll is rotation about the X axis, with an object with 0° roll having its positive body Z
    /// axis pointing along positive Z. For instance, in NED, after applying a yaw of 90° and a
    /// pitch of 45° (so the plane points directly East with its nose pitched up by 45°), applying
    /// a roll of 20° would result in the plane's nose still pointing in the same direction, but
    /// rotated clockwise about its own axis by 20°. There is no equivalent to roll in [`Bearing`].
    ///
    /// To determine the direction of rotation (ie, in which direction a positive angle goes), you
    /// can use the [right-hand rule for rotations][rhrot]: curl your fingers and stick your thumb
    /// out in the positive direction of the axis you want to check rotation around (eg, positive Z
    /// for yaw). The direction your fingers curl is the direction of (positive) rotation. Note
    /// that a counterclockwise rotation about a Z if positive Z is down is a clockwise rotation
    /// when viewed from negative Z (ie, "up"); this matches the common use of yaw in [`FrdLike`]
    /// where a positive yaw means "to the right", or in [`NedLike`] where a positive yaw means
    /// "eastward".
    ///
    /// Be aware that rotational angles have high ambiguities in literature and are easy to use

    /// direction in `In` (ie, to have an `Orientation<In>`); that the object's axes (ie, body
    /// coordinate system axes) "point" in that direction in `In`. Which in turn means that the
